## Analysis Pipeline

### 1. **Data Collection & Exploration**
- Loaded dataset using `pandas`
- Initial inspection for null values, data types, unique values

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns
- Handled missing values and outliers (e.g., in `Profit`, `Sales`)

## Summary Statistics:
Sales- The mean sales is $229.85,ranging from $0.44 to $22,638.48
Quantity- The mean quantity is 3.78,ranging from 1 to 14
Discount- The mean discount is 15.6 %,ranging from 0% to 80%
Profit- The mean profit is $28.65,ranging from $-6599.97 to $8399.97

## Dataset Shape Overview:
Complete Data: 9994 Rows, 21 Columns
This dataset provides comprehensive information about sales transactions, including customer details, product information, and financial data.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Sales & profit trends across categories and regions
- Discount vs Profit correlation
- Visualized sales by sub-category using bar plots
- KPI metrics (Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders)

### 4. **Feature Engineering (Optional)**
- Derived `Profitable` flag (binary)
- Created clusters using KMeans based on `Sales` and `Profit`

### 5. **Visualization**
- Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau and Streamlit
- Visual elements:
  - KPI Cards
  - Sales by Category/Sub-Category
  - Discount vs Profit
  - Regional performance

### 6. **Advanced Analysis (Optional)**
- Customer segmentation via clustering
- Predictive modeling using Random Forest (classification on profitability)

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard
A dynamic and insightful dashboard was created using Tableau and Streamlit:
- KPI cards for total sales, profit, and orders
- Regional heatmaps and bar charts
- Interactive filters for segment, category, and date


## Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Tableau / Streamlit

Git & GitHub

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

Office Supplies had the highest number of orders but not the highest profit.
Technology category showed strong profitability.
High discounts often led to negative profits.
Clustering identified high-value vs low-value customer segments.
